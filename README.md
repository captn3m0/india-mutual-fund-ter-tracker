Indian Mutual Funds TER Tracker
-------------------------------

Tracks expense ratio changes for Indian Mutual Funds.
Watch the repository for any releases to get notified of any changes.

- `data.csv` holds the data. The Field headers are the same as https://www.amfiindia.com/ter-of-mf-schemes, with the exception of the TER Date field, which is dropped.
- You can directly access the latest version at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/captn3m0/india-mutual-fund-ter-tracker/main/data.csv>.
- You can view the data online on GitHub at https://github.com/captn3m0/india-mutual-fund-ter-tracker/blob/main/data.csv

TODO: Create a Mastodon bot that posts updates as they happen.

## Why

The emails sent by Mutual Funds are quite useless, as they don't contain the actual TER change, just a notification of the change.
You're expected to go to the website, and find the TER details on your own.

This is a simple tracker that allows you to watch the TER changes for all funds.
